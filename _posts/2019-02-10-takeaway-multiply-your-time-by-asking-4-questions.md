Original [source](https://ideas.ted.com/multiply-your-time-by-asking-4-questions-about-the-stuff-on-your-to-do-list/amp/).

**Question 1 :: Can I eliminate this task?**

>  What you have to realize is that you are always saying ‘no’ to something because anytime you say ‘yes’ to one thing, you are simultaneously saying ‘no’ to an infinite number of others.

Taking a task is worth it? How much time would I be 'locked' in the task without the oportuinity to take another of higer payoff?

**If I can't eliminate this task, can I automate it?**

Look thinks that can be automated like:
* services (water, electricity, etc...) payment
* Groceries? recurrent shopping articles that can be delivered at home. Going to a store takes ~45 minutes, buying on-line takes ~5 minutes.

**Can it be delegated, or can I teach someone else how to do this?**

This is a tough one, the issue is find somebody willing to take a task!

**Should I do this task now, or can I do it later?*

> There’s a difference in waiting to do something that we know we should be doing … versus waiting to do something because we’re deciding that now is not the right time.

> When you procrastinate on purpose, you’ll eventually decide whether to eliminate, automate or delegate the task, or you may find that it’s risen in significance, importance or urgency, compelling you to do it.
